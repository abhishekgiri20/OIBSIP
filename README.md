# OASIS-INFOBYTE-JAVA-DEVELOPMENT-INTERNSHIP TASK-2

I have created this project successfully using jav. This is a number guessing game in which user can guess a number between 1 to 100 within the given no of attemps.

The fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:
1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
4. The game continues under the user guessing the number.
5. The game also limits the number of attempts.
